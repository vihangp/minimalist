![My MugShot](/assets/images/prof_pic_large.jpg){:height="200px" width="190px"} ||||I am a Ph.D candidate in Machine Learning at [Institute of Machine Learning, JKU Linz](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-for-machine-learning/), Austria and I am advised by [Prof. Sepp Hochreiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Hochreiter).

My life goal is to **push boundaries of humanity** and my **current** area of interest to do this is through **research** in learning systems/machine learning/reinforcement learning. 

More specifically, I want to work in finding how we can improve our current Reinforcement Learning methods. My research revolves around long term credit assignment in Reinforcement Learning and how we can build algorithms which learn to build temporal abstractions to learn faster and generalise to unknown environments. 

I completed my Bachelors in Engineering from University of Mumbai, where I built various kinds of robots (some of which played [badminton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfj4C9W8Lp8&list=PLzlqyUyoIAeKrWsyxdK00kTYIsfAp0Duj)!). Since, then I have been motivated to build robots which can improve themselves by interacting with the world. Further, I completed my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [USI](https://www.usi.ch/en), Switzerland.
