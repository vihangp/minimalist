### Research Oriented Projects
**Improving sampling in Evolution Strategies for Reinforcement Learning**: Designing a new hybrid method by combining Evolution strategies and Policy gradient methods. The work is still ongoing.

**Reward redistribution in Reinforcement Learning for long sequences**: Implemented [Reward redistribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07857) for tasks with extremely long delay in reward and even longer episode length. Designed and trained deep neural network architecture for this task. This was done as an Intern at Institute of Machine Learning, Linz, Austria. 

**ABU-ROBOCON competition**: Co-founded the team in 2013 and was programming lead(2013-2014) and Team leader(2015). Designed, built and programmed robots for tasks ranging from pick and place to playing double's [Badminton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfj4C9W8Lp8&list=PLzlqyUyoIAeKrWsyxdK00kTYIsfAp0Duj). Lead a team of 20 students (2015), and oversaw mechanical, electronics and software aspects of robot design. Improved rank to 10 from 40+ in the previous year's, in about 100 contesting teams at Robocon 2015.


### Selected Academic/Personal Projects

**Geometric Matrix Completion with Recurrent Multi-Graph Neural Networks**: Understand and replicate results for the paper "Geometric Matrix Completion with Recurrent Multi-Graph Neural Networks". Further extend it for separable convolutions. (Geometric Deep Learning May-2019 - Ongoing)


**Distributed Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic** : Implemented an A3C version for a cluster and analysed the scaling properties of the algorithm. Also, discussed new ways of making the algorithm more scalable. (Feb - May 2018) 

**Deep Reinforcement Learning agent for StarCraft II**: Developed a RL agent based on the idea of Dueling Deep Q-Network. Work done on one mini-game of StarCraft-II. (Deep Learning Lab Nov-2017)

**Leo Tolstoy-esque text generator using LSTM**: Generated text using a machine learning model trained on Leo Tolstoy's work. (Deep Learning Lab Oct-2017)

**Google Cloud & Youtube8M Video Understanding Challenge**: Implemented an LSTM recurrent network for video classification and was ranked in the top 20% of the participants. (Kaggle.com Jun-2017)

**The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring**: Implemented a convolutional neural network to detect and classify a fish and ranked in the top 3%. (Kaggle.com Mar-2017)

**Circuit board defect detection using Image Registration**: Used computer vision to detect and classify defects in printed circuit boards. (2014 -- 2015)
